# missing-data-in-text
This repository contains the group work for the "Missing Data" course at the University of Helsinki, taught by Maria Valaste. It focuses on methods for recovering missing text using transformer-based models like BERT and generative LLMs, including approaches for both single-token and multi-token masking, as well as OCR-based text reconstruction.
